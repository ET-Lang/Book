Data Types

The purpose of programming is to receive inputs and process them to produce an output. Keep in
mind that input values is the most important part of your work.

In the programming language, there are several types of data that we can use in the place where
it is needed: float, int, string, char, void, bool, null, ...

The type is to store individual char (such as ’a’, ’b’), The type is for storing int for keeping
Integer (such as 4, 32, 169) and the float type is used for decimal number such as 15.4, 64.26) And
we will explain the type of void later.

But keep in mind that each of them has limitations. So we have several types with the name int,
each of which has a limit. We can choose them according to the required range.
