All Facts about ET

The ET language has been designed by Max Base in 2012, Which was later developed by the Asrez
team. They tried to design a modern, more appropriate language. As simple as possible for humans.
Some features of the ET language:

- ET Language is a middle-level language. Programming languages can be divided into three
categories: high-level languages, middle level, low-level languages. (Table 1-1) The reason
for the middle-level language is that it is also low because it is capable of being closely related
to the hardware, like the assembly. And on the other side it is close to human expression and
has simple commands and is readiable for humans then this’s a feature of the high level
languages.

- ET language is a flexible and powerful language that does not create any restrictions for the
programmer, and you can take and create whatever you think.

- ET language is a portable language. This means that you can run the code written in a system
on another system. Without causing trouble or trouble.

- ET language is a multi-platform language. This means that when you design an application
for the Windows operating system. You can run it on another operating system, including
Linux series.

- The ET programming language has the ability to embed on a platform for another platform.
So you can design a program for Windows. You will not need to own a Windows operating
system. And this is a unique and wonderful feature.

- The ET programming language has tiny keywords. This means that the number of keywords
in this language is small. But this does not make you curious or can not produce any program.
However, the number of keywords is not a reason for the strength and speed of the compiler.
But these are the reasons for learning this programming language easier and faster.


Keywords: 
1. auto 
2. const 
3. break 
4. continue 
5. return 
6. if 
7. for 
8. foreach 
9. loop 
10. while 
11. do 
12. default 
13. switch 
14. else 
15. elseif 
16. elif 
17. extern 
18. struct 
19. enum 
20. static
21. goto 
22. union 
23. case 
24. register 
25. typedef 
26. assembly 
27. import 
28. ifdef 
29. ifndef 
30. define

ET Language is a system language. which you can even design system programs. System programs are programs that allow you to exploit hardware and software communitication. Some
system programs are: operating system / interpreter / compiler / database / word processor
and assembler and ...
 
 - There is a close connection between the ET and the assembly. This means that you can also
insert assembly code into this language. Of course, consider that they are controlled by a
separate processing engine.

- ET Language is a sensitive letter. This means that words in lowercase letters are different. So
be sure to type the letters you type in the letters you type.

- The ET language instructions are included in the following features:

1. There is no limit to the number of words per line.
2. It is recommended to write just one command per line
3. Ability to use; at the end of each instruction is optional
4. Each command can be written in several lines and lines. (You can create spaces or
empty space between your guides.
5. You can write comment in your code that you should use the principles of communication.


Data Types

The purpose of programming is to receive inputs and process them to produce an output. Keep in
mind that input values is the most important part of your work.

- In the programming language, there are several types of data that we can use in the place where
it is needed: float, int, string, char, void, bool, null, ...

- The type is to store individual char (such as ’a’, ’b’), The type is for storing int for keeping
Integer (such as 4, 32, 169) and the float type is used for decimal number such as 15.4, 64.26) And
we will explain the type of void later.

But keep in mind that each of them has limitations. So we have several types with the name int,
each of which has a limit. We can choose them according to the required range.


- int8 8bit, 1byte -127 until 128
- uint8 8bit, 1byte -127 until 128
- int16 16bit, 2byte -127 until 128
- uint16 16bit, 2byte -127 until 128
- int32 32bit, 3byte -127 until 128
- uint32 32bit, 3byte -127 until 128
- int64 64bit, 4byte -127 until 128
- uint64 64bit, 4byte -127 until 128
- size 64bit, 4byte -127 until 128
- float16 16bit, 2byte -127 until 128
- ufloat16 16bit, 2byte -127 until 128
- float32 32bit, 3byte -127 until 128
- ufloat32 32bit, 3byte -127 until 128
- char 8bit, 1byte -127 until 128
- uchar 16bit, 2byte -127 until 128
- mchar 16bit, 2byte -127 until 128
- bool 1bit true or false
- null 1bit empty


Variable

- A variable is a name for memory words that we put data into. And we may change them and use
them during the implementation of the program. To refer to their value, we use the same name,
which is the reason we name them so that they can be easily accessed.

- To name variables, we can use characters from a to z or A to Z. As well as numbers and _ char.
We do not have a number limit for the length of name of variables.

- Note that the name of the variables can not start with the number. (The first letter of the name
can not be a number)


Define Variable

- As mentioned, variables are memory spaces. So, as the data has the type. We must also specify the
type of variables. So the variable definition method will be:

- In this case, the variable type can be one of the values in Table 2

1.3.3 Name

- The reason for naming ET for this time was initially related to the concept of electronics and technology. But later on the suggestion of Javad Sabet the concept of the name has been changed. 
This language also means the language of the earth (earth tongue).

Definition 1.3.1 — Cone. A set K ∈ Rn , when x ∈ K implies αx ∈ K.

■ Example 1.1 — ludcator function. δc(x) = {
0 x ∈ C 
+∞ elsewhere
. domδc(x) = C


Chapter 1. ET Programming Language

Definition 1.3.2 — III. A function f : Rn → R¯ is Theorem 1.3.1 f : Rn → R¯ is convex ⇐⇒ ∀x, y ∈ Rn,α ∈ (0, 1), f(ax + (1−a)x) ≤ a f(x) + (1−a)f(x).
